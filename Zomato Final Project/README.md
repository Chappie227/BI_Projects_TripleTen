# Zomato Final Project

# Overview:

The purpose of the report is to find out what makes a restaurant popular and provide some recommendations to keep these restaurants successful. This can be done by looking into different factors such as location, ratings, rating count, cuisine type and revenue.

# Questions Asked for this Project:

• What restaurants are popular

• What kind of cuisine are popular (this will relate back to the restaurants and see if restaurants selling popular cuisines are more popular)

• Does rating counts equal a higher rating (looking at top 5)

• What restaurant generates the highest revenue

• Do restaurants that have more orders correlate to the restaurant having higher ratings

• Does the location of restaurant determine more popular reviews

# Findings:

After conducting my research, I have found that dessert, fast-food, and pizza restaurants are the highest performing restaurants in terms of revenue and ratings. Although a lot of them appear to be western chain restaurants, there are a few that are local and highly rated as well. What I recommend for these restaurants to do to maintain or receive higher ratings is to provide a coupon for customers who leave a review. Another way is by creating more ads (physical and online) to create more exposure. One other way can be creating a loyalty program for customers. This can also help with the issue of the downwards trend in revenue most of the restaurants are facing too. To investigate the reason why the revenue is decreasing, surveys can be sent out to customers on why or why not they will be returning to order from these restaurants.
