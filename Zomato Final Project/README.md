# Zomato Final Project

# Overview:

The purpose of the report is to find out what makes a restaurant popular and provide some recommendations to keep these restaurants successful. This can be done by looking into different factors such as location, ratings, rating count, cuisine type and revenue.

# Questions Asked for this Project:

• What restaurants are popular

• What kind of cuisine are popular (this will relate back to the restaurants and see if restaurants selling popular cuisines are more popular)

• Does rating counts equal a higher rating (looking at top 5)

• What restaurant generates the highest revenue

• Do restaurants that have more orders correlate to the restaurant having higher ratings

• Does the location of restaurant determine more popular reviews

# Findings:

After conducting my research, I have found that dessert, fast-food, and pizza restaurants are the highest performing restaurants in terms of revenue and ratings. Although a lot of them appear to be western chain restaurants, there are a few that are local and highly rated as well.
