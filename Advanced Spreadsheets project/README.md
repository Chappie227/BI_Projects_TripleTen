Overview:

For this task I am to help a client analyze the vacation rental market in the Manhattan borough of New York City. The client is interested in investing in several properties but would like some guidance on what types of properties they should be targeting. My role in the project is to analyze data collected on current Airbnb listings to identify useful insights.

Questions asked for this project:

•	Which type of properties should be targeted?
•	Which rentals are more attractive for vacation rentals?
•	Which size properties are more popular for vacation rentals?
•	What’s the average occupancy for each rental?

Findings:

Clients should focus on investing in Harlem as it is one of the best neighborhoods based on my findings. Customers tend too book properties that have 0 – 3 bedrooms and book during the weekdays. Although customers tend to book properties with less than 4 rooms, properties with 4 or more rooms tend to have a higher annual revenue due to the high price in renting.
